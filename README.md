# Involution 2023 内卷2023

Welcome to my involution repository where I spent billions of brain cells for the passionate of coding (or just to flex lol).

## About this
This is a repo to collect all of my coding challenges so that I can use it in future before any coding events & contests. All the codes may contain more than a single solution. So, you may try it out with your own solution based on your preferences. (sharing is caring, you may drop me a PR~)

## Why does this exist?
That's too much reason for why this stuff exist, since:
1. I can do some coding challenges when I'm free

2. Use here as the main "base" of storing my coding assignments & practices, or sometimes study material here :)

3. I was promised to attend coding competitions next year;-; 

4. Lazy to open another repo for my coding assignments

## My targets
I wish to solve at least a question a day to "call off" a tired day (but seriously as a high school student, this is impossible for me). And also by the time I'm solving questions, I can "help" others on their programming journey (since copying code is very easy)

## Conclusion
Self-learning journey is hard, of course. But at least... it is worth a lot for me. 

Just, enjoy. No pressures.
