# Involution 2023 内卷2023
Welcome to my involution repository where I burnt billions of brain cells for the passionate of coding.

## About this
This is a repo to collect all of my coding challenges so that I can revise it later in future before any coding event. 

## Why does this exist?
I made a shitty promise that if I got my nsspc correct for at least one question, I will attend it in next year. So this is why this repo begin.

## My targets
I wish to solve at least a question a day to "call off" a tired day, at least now I have the time to do it. But if I don't have enough time, it's ok. I will never kill myself just for programming.

## Conclusion
This is just a place with burnt brain cells. Nothing more.
