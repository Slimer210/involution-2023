# Involution 2023 内卷2023
Welcome to my involution repository where I burnt billions of brain cells for the passionate of coding.

## About this
This is a repo to collect all of my coding challenges so that I can revise it later in future before any coding event. 

## Why is it "Involution"
The term of "involution" is the opposite of evolution, means everyone remain in the same state just to do something without making any new changes into it.

The purpose of I made this as I just sitting in front of my computer and doing a lot of coding challenges, but in this time mostly everyone is enjoying their life and I just smash my lovely keyboard.

## My targets
I wish to solve at least a question a day to "call off" a tired day, at least now I have the time to do it. But if I don't have enough time, it's ok. I will never kill myself just for programming.

## Conclusion
This is just a place with burnt brain cells. Nothing more.
