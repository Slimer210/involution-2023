# Involution 2023

Welcome to my involution repository where I spent billions of brain cells for the passionate of coding (or just to flex lol).

_(Updated 2nd Sep 2023) Finally after bunch of practices, the NSSPC finals finally ended. I really appreciated for those who supported me along these moments. Thanks for drawing me a new memories in my mind, and I really appreciated any presence._

_(Updated 14th April 2023) This is too funny I think... I don't know why I'm trying to waste more time on this. I'm already get busy but I still want... Haiyaa I shouldn't make those low quality promise._

## About this
This is a repo to collect all of my coding challenges so that I can use it in future before any coding events & contests. All the codes may contain more than a single solution. So, you may try it out with your own solution based on your preferences. (sharing is caring, you may drop me a PR~)

## Why does this exist?
1. To keep my school notes & assignments

2. Use here as the main "base" of storing my coding assignments & practices, or sometimes study material here :)

3. I was promised to attend coding competitions next year;-; 

## My targets
(I confess, just ignore this. I'm such a procastinated person)
I wish to solve at least a question a day to "call off" a tired day (but seriously as a high school student, this is impossible for me). And also by the time I'm solving questions, I can "help" others on their programming journey (since copying code is very easy)

## Conclusion
Actually here is just a backup of my solutions & notes.
