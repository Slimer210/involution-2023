# Involution 2023 内卷2023

Welcome to my involution repository where I burnt billions of brain cells for the passionate of coding.

## About this
This is a repo to collect all of my coding challenges so that I can revise it later in future before any coding event. All the codes may contain more than a single solution. So, you may try it out with different solution based on my standard solution. (If you have a better solution just kinda drop me a PR, thanks a lot~)

## Why does this exist?
I made a shitty promise that if I got my nsspc correct for at least one question, I will attend it in next year. And the competition ended up with one question correct only. So, to obey my promise, I decided to prepare for the next year coding event.

## My targets
I wish to solve at least a question a day to "call off" a tired day, at least now I have the time to do it. But if I don't have enough time, it's ok. I will never give up my academic skills just for programming, because that's more important.

## Conclusion
This is just a place with burnt brain cells. Nothing else.
